# Mental-health-chatbot-
Mental health chatbots are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that are designed to help you with your mental health.
Motivation behind this project

In 2017, the National Mental Health Survey reported that one in seven people in India suffered from mental disorders, including depression and anxiety. The increasing awareness of mental health has made it a primary concern of development. Nearly 150 million people in India needed interventions, where the low and middle class faced more burden than the well-off people. This project is an attempt to make mental health more accessible. This conversational agent can be complemented with clinicians to make it more effective and fruitful.

This project is retrieval-based.

Retrieval-based Chatbots: A retrieval-based chatbot uses Machine Learning ensembles as heuristics for evaluation. Similar to rule-based chatbots, they do not generate new texts.
